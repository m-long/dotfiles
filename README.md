dotfiles
========

This is my dotfile repository for all of my configuration files for my commonly used command line tools. Namely, i3, zsh (my shell), prezto (oh-my-zsh branch), ranger (terminal file browser), vim (text editor), and tmux.

Consolidation
-------------

I moved all of the dotfiles into a separate directory for ease of management, using symlinks in the original locations. You will want to add them as follows:
- i3: ~/
- zsh: replace current ones in ~/
- prezto: replace current ones in ~/
- ranger: ~/.config/ranger
- vim: ~/
- tmux: ~/
